# Site-Blocker

This is a site blocker written in python.

It writes that website that you want to block into the host file, and assigns it the localhost ip address, so that it cannot be accessed on the internet.
It is run as a shortcut from a batchfile, in order to give it administrator provileges, so that it can edit and save protected files, such as the hosts file.
